          <p className="about__text">
            Iâ€™m Kirk, a full-stack developer based in New York City. I built
            FoodRat as a capstone project for BrainStationâ€™s Software
            Engineering Immersive after receiving a full scholarship to the
            program in early 2024. FoodRat leverages many of the technologies
            I've learned including React, Node.js, Axios, and SQL.
          </p>

          <p className="about__text">
            The idea behind FoodRat emerged from my personal experiences of
            being stuck with limited dinner options during late nights dedicated
            to learning to become a software engineer. This project allowed me
            to tackle a practical problem while working with a large,
            continuously updated dataset.
          </p>

          <p className="about__text">
            I particularly enjoyed the challenge of implementing custom map
            styling and integrating unique markers with the Google Maps API.
            Throughout the development process, I focused on efficiently
            managing API calls through a custom debouncing script, resulting in
            a more responsive user experience.
          </p>

          <p className="about__text">
            I hope you enjoy FoodRat! I believe it reflects my passion as a
            maker and my commitment to creating tools that are fun and enhance
            everyday life. I am eager to pivot towards new opportunities, learn
            from experienced software engineers, and contribute my skills to
            impactful projects. I would love to connect!
